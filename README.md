# Description
This will be a repository containing the different implementations of
Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms for my CV-ML course.

I will try to include an explanation for the different problems and solutions
aswell as the explanation for the algorithms.

This course is taught by the members of the Computational Learning and Imaging Research Laboratory
at the Universidad Autonoma de Yucat√°n.
